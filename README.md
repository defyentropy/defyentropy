**ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @scientist27.**
Iâ€™m interested in web development, because the internet is one of the most powerful platforms out there today, in my opinion. Iâ€™m currently brushing up my HTML and CSS before moving on to JavaScript, after which I will start learning frameworks like React.

However, like many others, my first language was Python, and I still love working with it, so I occasionally build simple command-line apps with it as well.

You can view my work on my GitHub page (which you are presumably on anyway).
